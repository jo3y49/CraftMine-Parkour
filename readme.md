# CraftMine Parkour

A 3D platforming game, where the objective is to reach the highest block in the sky. Everytime you touch the block, you gain a point, and you must touch the ground before you can go back up and get another one. Watch out for the enemies in the middle! If they catch you, you will get launched.
